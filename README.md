# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

I created this website to showcase my work and abilities to future employers. I will keep updating as my skills improve and as I create more projects so that by the time I am ready to search for jobs, I have an extensive portfolio to present as a representation of my talents. Working on this I learned how much the work load can pile up on you as this was a fairly big project. It gave me a better mindset going forward towards my future jobs and what kind of workload to expect.
