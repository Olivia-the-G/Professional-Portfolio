          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi, My name is Olivia and I'm a new web developer starting out in my career. I've been learning about coding for about 6 months now and I am currently studying at the University of Toronto in their FullStack Webdeveloper Bootcamp. Down the road I hope to become skilled enough that I can create a social media platform for local musicians to gain followings in their areas. Social media is a tool that has opened up so many opportunities for people, and it's made it much easier to spread information to those in your area. My goal is to help bring back the sense of community that has been lost over recent years. People need somewhere they can go to meet the ones they live so close to yet don't interact with in their daily lives. This is a way to provide that for many communities while using the resources and locations they already have at their disposal. This can not only help performers but also venues, small businesses, local vendors, and artists who need somewhere to promote themsleves.</p>
